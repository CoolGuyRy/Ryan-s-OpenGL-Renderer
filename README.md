# Ryan-s-OpenGL-Renderer
This project will reflect my journey as I learn about OpenGL. I will be following OpenGL SuperBible by Graham Sellers, Richard Wright, and Nicholas Haemel

So I have finally decided on a direction to take this project. I want to create a 3D level editor with the assets I have already. I want to implement a
simple phong lighting system. And add some shadows at the very end.
